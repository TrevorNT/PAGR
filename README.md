PAGR
====

A utility which schedules tables for restaurant patrons and provides an interface for reservations; the smartphone interface for this utility alerts customers when their tables are ready, replacing those handheld buzzers (hence the name).

This project is being carried out by the four-person PAGR group of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Fall 2013 Software Design and Documentation class (CSCI-4440).
